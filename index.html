                    Polaris, also known as the North Star, has been 
                    identified as natural navigation by scientific research. The 
                    main reason for this is that it located directly on the North 
                    Pole. Especially on hikes, they use the same North Star to determine 
                    the path and direction. In addition, mariners in the northern hemisphere, 
                    depending on North Star's height in the atmosphere, can calculate their 
                    latitude in the north or south of the equator.<br>More clearly, Polaris is 
                    used as navigation.
                <br><br>
                    The main reason this page is named "Polaris" is that it is "navigation" or 
                    "guide". Programming and coding help children view abstract ideas, make mathematics 
                    enjoyable and imaginative, and improve their problem-solving abilities. They are 
                    available in many STEM programs today. By practicing, they learn and strengthen their 
                    intellectuals. "Polaris" will play the role of navigation for people as they learn and practice 
                    coding and programming information.

                        We hope that Polaris, which is used in science, in certain jobs, 
                        and in the orientation problems people face in real life, will also play the role 
                        of a navigator in the field of technology and programming.
