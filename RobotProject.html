                    The robots have always been an interesting technology that can be programmed 
                    to move, make sound, light up and follow directions. Nothing is as enjoyable 
                    — and informative — as to build own robot and bring it at a speed of a sprint, 
                    event or competition.

                In the classroom environment, robots foster problem solving, innovative thinking, 
                and a positive feeling of competitiveness that fuels student creativity. The lack of 
                access to the tools needed to create and program robots in educational institutions 
                negatively affects students' ability to develop their technical skills and interest 
                in robotic projects.These discourage prevent many students from entering the robotic 
                world although the basic principles of robotics are explained in certain lessons approved 
                by the Ministries of Education. However it is noticeable that In the 21st century, these 
                difficulties are being overcome  with the US-Danish toy company Lego and its product Lego 
                Mindstorms.

                    Due to the pandemic, education in the universities continues to be conducted 
                    online. For this reason, there are a number of assignments at ADA University, 
                    especially those based on problem-solving skills that can be prepared through 
                    the Internet and technology. One of them is the "Robotic Project". Since the 
                    device required for the task is not available, this task will be solved by us 
                    as "programmers living in previous years". More clearly, earlier programmers 
                    coded programs that were completely imaginary. They made a plan and estimated 
                    its working principle without any technological assistance. Now we have the 
                    opportunity to test our thinking skills and travel to the "ancient programmer's 
                    life." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we do not have the opportunity to meet, we share and hold our plans and 
                    meetings online. Also, the "Zoom" online platform has been our assistant during 
                    online meetings.
