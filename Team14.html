                <p>
                    I am Nabat Gasimzade, 18 years old. I was admitted to ADA University in 2019 
                    and am currently studying Computer Science. The main reason for choosing this 
                    profession is to achieve my goal of becoming a well-known programmer. As it is 
                    know, with the development of technology, the world is evolving. In education, 
                    the help of technology, especially during the pandemic, has indescribable 
                    advantage. Online tutoring programs contribute to students' education and the 
                    performance of educators. In the future, I would like to contribute to the 
                    creation of such programs, as well as web pages. To achieve this goal, I created 
                    my first website, Caseacademic.com, with my partner N. Jabbarli, and we will do our best to develop 
                    it.

                    "My name is Farid Mehdiyev. I am 18 years old. I was born on the west 
                    side of Azerbaijan which is called Ganja. I'm studying at the ADA University 
                    which is established in Azerbaijan, Baku. My faculty is Information Technologies 
                    at ADA University. I choose that faculty because of technological things and I 
                    think that technology will significantly improve, especially programming, in the 
                    next years. My hobbies are reading books and likewise playing video games when 
                    I have leisure time. From my own perspective, I have great interests. For instance, 
                    in the field of business like trading, marketing and also selling online is my favorite 
                    thing to do. Likewise, I also like to do programming"
