                <p>
                    The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts.

                        The Hour of Code is an annual global event that people are taught straightforwardly 
                    the fundamentals of computer programming in 1 hour in an entertaining way. This 
                    event is part of a nonprofit organization initiated in the United States by 
                    Code.org,  to incorporate the importance of technical skill in the US curriculum 
                    and increase awareness about coding. In addition, with the Hour of Code, it is 
                    more productive to discover highly technical children, to facilitate the use of 
                    digital devices by technophobic children, especially those studying in remote 
                    rural areas who are unable to use technology due to their financial situation, 
                    and to help contribute to the future of technology by increasing interest in areas 
                    such as the School of Information and Technology. It is a notable result that with 
                    the organization of this event in countries around the world, the interest of girls 
                    in the field of SITE and research is growing. Several of these events have been held 
                    in Azerbaijan, one of which was held in December with the support of ADA University, 
                    led by Nabat Gaimzada, Iltun Huseynli, Farid Mehdiyev, and Nijat Shirinov.

                    Our "Hour of Code" project was started in the. First of all, we have to choose a school 
                    for our project. After that, we decided to choose the school of "District of Zangilan – 
                    number of 19th schools" which is established in Sumgait. Our group started meeting at the 
                    digital platform of "Zoom" at the beginning of preparing. Choosing 7th grades for a teaching 
                    game called “Classic Maze” which is appropriate for 12-13 years old children was decided. 
                    Our activity day was planned to start 12th of December at 9.30 in the meeting zoom. They 
                    were approximately 23 participants in an online meeting. Our group member Nijat Shirinov 
                    started to talk first about ADA University. Then, Nabat Gasimzade started to give questions 
                    to test children’s information about programming. Afterward, Farid Mehdiyev started tutoring 
                    part of programming. He talked about movements and limitations in the “Classic Maze”. After 
                    Farid finished, Iltun Huseynov continues to talk the game.
