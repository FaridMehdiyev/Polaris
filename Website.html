                        In the 21st century, at a time when technology is dominant, people are getting the information or data they are looking for through the Internet.
                        Online libraries, online news websites that replace newspapers, and websites that cover education and other areas are visited by people on a daily basis.
                        Notable, websites and programs that include daily tutorials and quizzes that contribute to education during a pandemic have special roles to play.
                        But how are these web pages and programs create?
                        What we need to know to create them and which online or visual aids can be used?
                        We will try to answer these questions on behalf of Polaris and team members.

                        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a special hypertext language for creating any document 
                        or page that can be read by a browser. HTML is a fundamental base technology of the Internet 
                        and is a language based on descriptors that define the type and function of a web page. Reports 
                        collected on all web destinations and shown on the screens of computers associated with the Web 
                        are composed in HTML program code. HTML - permits you to put content squares, pictures on pages, 
                        make tables, select colors for the archive and the content within the report, include interactive 
                        media components, make hyperlinks, and joints between all these components.

                     <p>
                        Javascript is a dynamic programming language mainly used in web browsers. JavaScript is a 
                        prototype-based scripting language with dynamic types and first-class functions. It has object-oriented, 
                        imperative, and functional programming principles. The writing style of JavaScript is derived from the C 
                        programming language. Its semantics and design are inspired by the Self and Scheme programming languages.
